## TEST IT

- you can test it by generating load using the python injector
  - `python test.py <weather> <loop>`
  - first arg is weather between `sun`, `rain`or `snow`
  - second arg is nb of loop, which is an int
  - see test.py code if you want to change the load generated (nb of queries and concurrency)
